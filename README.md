# TicTacToeAndroid
TicTacToeAndroid is a Unity project
with both Android and Windows support.
The game is a modified version of the
Tic-Tac-Toe implementation from this
[Unity tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/tic-tac-toe/introduction-and-setting-project).
The game adds an AI opponent
which utilizes the [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)
algorithm, and will always
select perfect moves.
